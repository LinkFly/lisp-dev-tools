;;; Statistical profiler.

;;; Overview:
;;;
;;; This profiler arranges for SIGPROF interrupts to interrupt a
;;; running program at regular intervals.  Each time a SIGPROF occurs,
;;; the current program counter and return address is recorded in a
;;; vector, until a configurable maximum number of samples have been
;;; taken.
;;;
;;; A profiling report is generated from the samples array by
;;; determining the Lisp functions corresponding to the recorded
;;; addresses.  Each program counter/return address pair forms one
;;; edge in a call graph.

;;; Problems:
;;;
;;; The code being generated on x86 makes determining callers reliably
;;; something between extremely difficult and impossible.  Example:
;;;
;;; 10979F00:       .entry eval::eval-stack-args(arg-count)
;;;       18:       pop     dword ptr [ebp-8]
;;;       1B:       lea     esp, [ebp-32]
;;;       1E:       mov     edi, edx
;;;
;;;       20:       cmp     ecx, 4
;;;       23:       jne     L4
;;;       29:       mov     [ebp-12], edi
;;;       2C:       mov     dword ptr [ebp-16], #x28F0000B ; nil
;;;                                              ; No-arg-parsing entry point
;;;       33:       mov     dword ptr [ebp-20], 0
;;;       3A:       jmp     L3
;;;       3C: L0:   mov     edx, esp
;;;       3E:       sub     esp, 12
;;;       41:       mov     eax, [#x10979EF8]    ; #<FDEFINITION object for eval::eval-stack-pop>
;;;       47:       xor     ecx, ecx
;;;       49:       mov     [edx-4], ebp
;;;       4C:       mov     ebp, edx
;;;       4E:       call    dword ptr [eax+5]
;;;       51:       mov     esp, ebx
;;;
;;; Suppose this function is interrupted by SIGPROF at 4E.  At that
;;; point, the frame pointer EBP has been modified so that the
;;; original return address of the caller of eval-stack-args is no
;;; longer where it can be found by x86-call-context, and the new
;;; return address, for the call to eval-stack-pop, is not yet on the
;;; stack.  The effect is that x86-call-context returns something
;;; bogus, which leads to wrong edges in the call graph.
;;;
;;; One thing that one might try is filtering cases where the program
;;; is interrupted at a call instruction.  But since the above example
;;; of an interrupt at a call instruction isn't the only case where
;;; the stack is something x86-call-context can't really cope with,
;;; this is not a general solution.
;;;
;;; Random ideas for implementation:
;;;
;;; * Space profiler.  Sample when new pages are allocated instead of
;;; at SIGPROF.
;;;
;;; * Record a configurable number of callers up the stack.  That
;;; could give a more complete graph when there are many small
;;; functions.
;;;
;;; * Print help strings for reports, include hints to the problem
;;; explained above.
;;;
;;; * Make flat report the default since call-graph isn't that
;;; reliable?

   :ALLOC-INTERVAL <n>
     Take a sample every time <n> allocation regions (approximately
     8kB) have been allocated since the last sample. Default is
     *ALLOC-INTERVAL*.

   :MODE <mode>
     If :CPU, run the profiler in CPU profiling mode. If :ALLOC, run the
     profiler in allocation profiling mode. If :TIME, run the profiler
     in wallclock profiling mode.

   :MAX-SAMPLES <max>
     Repeat evaluating body until <max> samples are taken.

   :MAX-DEPTH <max>
     Maximum call stack depth that the profiler should consider. Only

   :REPORT <type>
     If specified, call REPORT with :TYPE <type> at the end.

   :RESET <bool>
     It true, call RESET at the beginning.

   :THREADS <list-form>
     Form that evaluates to the list threads to profile, or :ALL to indicate
     that all threads should be profiled. Defaults to the current
     thread. (Note: START-PROFILING defaults to all threads.)

   :MAX <max>

   :MIN-PERCENT <min-percent>
      Don't show functions taking less than <min-percent> of the
      total time in the flat report.

   :SORT-BY <column>

      If :CUMULATIVE-SAMPLES, sort flat report by cumulative number of samples
      taken (shows how much time each function spent on stack.) Default
      is *REPORT-SORT-BY*.

   :SORT-ORDER <order>
      If :DESCENDING, sort flat report in descending order. If :ASCENDING,
      sort flat report in ascending order. Default is *REPORT-SORT-ORDER*.

   :SHOW-PROGRESS <bool>
     If true, print progress messages while generating the call graph.

   :CALL-GRAPH <graph>
     Print a report from <graph> instead of the latest profiling
     results.

;;; track cpu usage / consing. (For example, compiling asdf 20 times
;;; took 13s normally, 15s with call counting for all functions in
;;; SB-C, and 94s with SB-PROFILE profiling SB-C).
