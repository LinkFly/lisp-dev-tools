SYSTEM-SPECIFIC HINTS

for NetBSD:
  NetBSD 2.0 and above are required because of the lack of needed
  signal APIs in NetBSD 1.6 and earlier.

for OpenBSD:
  OpenBSD 3.0 has stricter ulimit values, and/or enforces them more
  strictly, than its predecessors. Therefore SBCL's initial mmap()
  won't work unless you increase the limit on the data segment from
  the OpenBSD defaults, e.g. with
    ulimit -S -d 1000000
  before you run SBCL. Otherwise SBCL fails with a message like
  "ensure_space: failed to validate xxxxxxx bytes at yyyyy". (SBCL
  is just allocating this huge address space, not actually using this
  huge memory at this point. OpenBSD <3.0 had no problem with this,
  but OpenBSD 3.0 is less hospitable.)
