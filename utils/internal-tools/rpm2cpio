# why does the world need another rpm2cpio?  because the existing one
# won't build unless you have half a ton of things that aren't really
# required for it, since it uses the same library used to extract RPM's.
# in particular, it won't build on the HPsUX box i'm on.

# sw 2002-Mar-6 Don't slurp the whole file
# Stefan 2010-Mar-10 Add bzip2 support

# add a path if desired

Here's how to use cpio:
     list of contents:   cpio -t -i < /file/name
        extract files:   cpio -d -i < /file/name
