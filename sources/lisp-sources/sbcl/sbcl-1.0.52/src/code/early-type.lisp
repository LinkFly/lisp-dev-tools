There may be different metrics on what constitutes a \"valid type
specifier\" depending on context. If this function does not suit your
exact need, you may be able to craft a particular solution using a
combination of DEFINED-TYPE-NAME-P and the TYPEXPAND functions.

The definition of \"valid type specifier\" employed by this function
is based on the following mnemonic:

          \"Would TYPEP accept it as second argument?\"

Except that unlike TYPEP, this function fully supports compound
FUNCTION type specifiers, and the VALUES type specifier, too.

In particular, VALID-TYPE-SPECIFIER-P will return NIL if
TYPE-SPECIFIER is not a class, not a symbol that is known to name a
type specifier, and not a cons that represents a known compound type
specifier in a syntactically and recursively correct way.

Examples:

  (valid-type-specifier-p '(cons * *))     => T
  (valid-type-specifier-p '#:foo)          => NIL
  (valid-type-specifier-p '(cons * #:foo)) => NIL
