;;; This warning refers to the flexibility in the ANSI spec with
;;; regard to run-time distinctions between floating point types.
;;; (E.g. the cross-compilation host might not even distinguish
;;; between SINGLE-FLOAT and DOUBLE-FLOAT, so a DOUBLE-FLOAT number
;;; would test positive as SINGLE-FLOAT.) If the target SBCL does make
;;; this distinction, then information is lost. It's not too hard to
;;; contrive situations where this would be a problem. In practice we
;;; don't tend to run into them because all widely used Common Lisp
;;; environments do recognize the distinction between SINGLE-FLOAT and
;;; DOUBLE-FLOAT, and we don't really need the other distinctions
;;; (e.g. between SHORT-FLOAT and SINGLE-FLOAT), so we call
;;; WARN-POSSIBLE-CROSS-TYPE-FLOAT-INFO-LOSS to test at runtime
;;; whether we need to worry about this at all, and not warn unless we
;;; do. If we *do* have to worry about this at runtime, my (WHN
;;; 19990808) guess is that the system will break in multiple places,
;;; so this is a real WARNING, not just a STYLE-WARNING.
