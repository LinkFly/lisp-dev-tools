;;;; macros for dynamically enabling and disabling signal handling

;;; Notes on how the without-interrupts/with-interrupts stuff works:
;;;
;;; Before invoking the supplied handler for any of the signals that
;;; can be blocked, the C interrupt support code checks to see whether
;;; *interrupts-enabled* has been bound to NIL. If so, it saves the
;;; signal number and the value of the signal mask (from the signal
;;; context), sets the signal mask to block all blockable signals,
;;; sets *interrupt-pending* and returns without handling the signal.
;;;
;;; When we drop out the without interrupts, we check to see whether
;;; *INTERRUPT-PENDING* has been set. If so, we call
;;; RECEIVE-PENDING-INTERRUPT, which generates a SIGTRAP. The C code
;;; invokes the handler for the saved signal instead of the SIGTRAP
;;; after replacing the signal mask in the signal context with the
;;; saved value. When that hander returns, the original signal mask is
;;; installed, allowing any other pending signals to be handled.
;;;
;;; This means that the cost of WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS is just a special
;;; binding in the case when no signals are delivered (the normal
;;; case). It's only when a signal is actually delivered that we use
;;; any system calls, and by then the cost of the extra system calls
;;; are lost in the noise when compared with the cost of delivering
;;; the signal in the first place.
;;;
;;; The conditional bindings done by this code here are worth the
;;; trouble as binding is more expensive then read & test -- so
;;;  (if *foo*
;;;      (foo)
;;;      (let ((*foo* t))
;;;        (foo)))
;;; is faster then
;;;  (let ((*foo* t))
;;;    (foo))
;;; provided that the first branch is true "often enough".

(defvar *interrupts-enabled* t)
(defvar *interrupt-pending* nil)
(defvar *allow-with-interrupts* t)
;;; This is to support signal handlers that want to return to the
;;; interrupted context without leaving anything extra on the stack. A
;;; simple
;;;
;;;  (without-interrupts
;;;   (unblock-deferrable-signals)
;;;   (allow-with-interrupts ...))
;;;
;;; would not cut it, as upon leaving WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS the pending
;;; handlers is run with stuff from the function in which this is
;;; still on the stack.

(sb!xc:defmacro without-interrupts (&body body)
  #!+sb-doc
  "Executes BODY with all deferrable interrupts disabled. Deferrable
interrupts arriving during execution of the BODY take effect after BODY has
been executed.

Deferrable interrupts include most blockable POSIX signals, and
SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD. Does not interfere with garbage collection, and
unlike in many traditional Lisps using userspace threads, in SBCL
WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS does not inhibit scheduling of other threads.

Binds ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS and WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS as a local macros.

ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS allows the WITH-INTERRUPTS to take effect during the
dynamic scope of its body, unless there is an outer WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS without
a corresponding ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS.

WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS executes its body with interrupts enabled provided that
for there is an ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS for every WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS surrounding
the current one. WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS is equivalent to:

  (allow-with-interrupts (with-interrupts ...))

Care must be taken not to let either ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS or
WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS appear in a function that escapes from inside the
WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS in:

  (without-interrupts
    ;; The body of the lambda would be executed with WITH-INTERRUPTS allowed
    ;; regardless of the interrupt policy in effect when it is called.
    (lambda () (allow-with-interrupts ...)))

  (without-interrupts
    ;; The body of the lambda would be executed with interrupts enabled
    ;; regardless of the interrupt policy in effect when it is called.
    (lambda () (with-local-interrupts ...)))
