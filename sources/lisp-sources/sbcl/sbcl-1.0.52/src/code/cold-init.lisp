;;; There's a fair amount of machinery which is needed only at cold
;;; init time, and should be discarded before freezing the final
;;; system. We discard it by uninterning the associated symbols.
;;; Rather than using a special table of symbols to be uninterned,
;;; which might be tedious to maintain, instead we use a hack:
;;; anything whose name matches a magic character pattern is
;;; uninterned.
;;;
;;; FIXME: Are there other tables that need to have entries removed?
;;; What about symbols of the form DEF!FOO?
