;;;; This file contains things for the extensions packages (SB-EXT and
;;;; also "internal extensions" SB-INT) which can't be built at
;;;; cross-compile time, and perhaps also some things which might as
;;;; well not be built at cross-compile time because they're not
;;;; needed then. Things which can't be built at cross-compile time
;;;; (e.g. because they need machinery which only exists inside SBCL's
;;;; implementation of the LISP package) do not belong in this file.
