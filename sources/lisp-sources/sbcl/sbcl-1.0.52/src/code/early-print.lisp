;;;; circularity detection stuff

;;; When *PRINT-CIRCLE* is T, this gets bound to a hash table that
;;; (eventually) ends up with entries for every object printed. When
;;; we are initially looking for circularities, we enter a T when we
;;; find an object for the first time, and a 0 when we encounter an
;;; object a second time around. When we are actually printing, the 0
;;; entries get changed to the actual marker value when they are first
;;; printed.
(defvar *circularity-hash-table* nil)

;;; When NIL, we are just looking for circularities. After we have
;;; found them all, this gets bound to 0. Then whenever we need a new
;;; marker, it is incremented.
(defvar *circularity-counter* nil)

;;; Check to see whether OBJECT is a circular reference, and return
;;; something non-NIL if it is. If ASSIGN is true, reference
;;; bookkeeping will only be done for existing entries, no new
;;; references will be recorded. If ASSIGN is true, then the number to
;;; use in the #n= and #n# noise is assigned at this time.
;;;
;;; Note: CHECK-FOR-CIRCULARITY must be called *exactly* once with
;;; ASSIGN true, or the circularity detection noise will get confused
;;; about when to use #n= and when to use #n#. If this returns non-NIL
;;; when ASSIGN is true, then you must call HANDLE-CIRCULARITY on it.
;;; If CHECK-FOR-CIRCULARITY returns :INITIATE as the second value,
;;; you need to initiate the circularity detection noise, e.g. bind
;;; *CIRCULARITY-HASH-TABLE* and *CIRCULARITY-COUNTER* to suitable values
;;; (see #'OUTPUT-OBJECT for an example).
;;;
;;; Circularity detection is done in two places, OUTPUT-OBJECT and
;;; WITH-CIRCULARITY-DETECTION (which is used from PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK).
;;; These checks aren't really redundant (at least I can't really see
;;; a clean way of getting by with the checks in only one of the places).
;;; This causes problems when mixed with pprint-dispatching; an object is
;;; marked as visited in OUTPUT-OBJECT, dispatched to a pretty printer
;;; that uses PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK (directly or indirectly), leading to
;;; output like #1=#1#. The MODE parameter is used for detecting and
;;; correcting this problem.
