;;; Define a hash cache that associates some number of argument values
;;; with a result value. The TEST-FUNCTION paired with each ARG-NAME
;;; is used to compare the value for that arg in a cache entry with a
;;; supplied arg. The TEST-FUNCTION must not error when passed NIL as
;;; its first arg, but need not return any particular value.
;;; TEST-FUNCTION may be any thing that can be placed in CAR position.
;;;
;;; This code used to store all the arguments / return values directly
;;; in the cache vector. This was both interrupt- and thread-unsafe, since
;;; it was possible that *-CACHE-ENTER would scribble over a region of the
;;; cache vector which *-CACHE-LOOKUP had only partially processed. Instead
;;; we now store the contents of each cache bucket as a separate array, which
;;; is stored in the appropriate cell in the cache vector. A new bucket array
;;; is created every time *-CACHE-ENTER is called, and the old ones are never
;;; modified. This means that *-CACHE-LOOKUP will always work with a set
;;; of consistent data. The overhead caused by consing new buckets seems to
;;; be insignificant on the grand scale of things. -- JES, 2006-11-02

;;; <name>-CACHE-LOOKUP Arg*
;;;   See whether there is an entry for the specified ARGs in the
;;;   cache. If not present, the :DEFAULT keyword (default NIL)
;;;   determines the result(s).
;;; <name>-CACHE-ENTER Arg* Value*
;;;   Encache the association of the specified args with VALUE.
;;; <name>-CACHE-CLEAR
;;;   Reinitialize the cache, invalidating all entries and allowing
;;;   the arguments and result values to be GC'd.
;;;
;;; These other keywords are defined:
;;; :HASH-BITS <n>
;;;   The size of the cache as a power of 2.
;;; :HASH-FUNCTION function
;;;   Some thing that can be placed in CAR position which will compute
;;;   a value between 0 and (1- (expt 2 <hash-bits>)).
;;; :VALUES <n>
;;;   the number of return values cached for each function call
;;; :INIT-WRAPPER <name>
;;;   The code for initializing the cache is wrapped in a form with
;;;   the specified name. (:INIT-WRAPPER is set to COLD-INIT-FORMS
;;;   in type system definitions so that caches will be created
