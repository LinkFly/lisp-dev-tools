  "A READTABLE is a data structure that maps characters into syntax
   types for the Common Lisp expression reader."
  ;; The CHARACTER-ATTRIBUTE-TABLE is a vector of BASE-CHAR-CODE-LIMIT
  ;; integers for describing the character type. Conceptually, there
  ;; are 4 distinct "primary" character attributes:
  ;; +CHAR-ATTR-WHITESPACE+, +CHAR-ATTR-TERMINATING-MACRO+,
  ;; +CHAR-ATTR-ESCAPE+, and +CHAR-ATTR-CONSTITUENT+. Non-terminating
  ;; macros (such as the symbol reader) have the attribute
  ;; +CHAR-ATTR-CONSTITUENT+.
  ;;
  ;; In order to make READ-TOKEN fast, all this information is stored
  ;; in the character attribute table by having different varieties of
  ;; constituents.
