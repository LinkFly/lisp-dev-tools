;;; FIXME: the below shouldn't really be here, but in documentation
;;; (chapter 19 makes a lot of requirements for documenting
;;; implementation-dependent decisions), but anyway it's probably not
;;; what we currently do.
;;;
;;; Unix namestrings have the following format:
;;;
;;; namestring := [ directory ] [ file [ type [ version ]]]
;;; directory := [ "/" ] { file "/" }*
;;; file := [^/]*
;;; type := "." [^/.]*
;;; version := "." ([0-9]+ | "*")
;;;
;;; Note: this grammar is ambiguous. The string foo.bar.5 can be
;;; parsed as either just the file specified or as specifying the
;;; file, type, and version. Therefore, we use the following rules
;;; when confronted with an ambiguous file.type.version string:
;;;
;;; - If the first character is a dot, it's part of the file. It is not
;;; considered a dot in the following rules.
;;;
;;; - Otherwise, the last dot separates the file and the type.
;;;
;;; Wildcard characters:
;;;
;;; If the directory, file, type components contain any of the
;;; following characters, it is considered part of a wildcard pattern
;;; and has the following meaning.
;;;
;;; ? - matches any one character
;;; * - matches any zero or more characters.
;;; [abc] - matches any of a, b, or c.
;;; {str1,str2,...,strn} - matches any of str1, str2, ..., or strn.
;;;   (FIXME: no it doesn't)
;;;
;;; Any of these special characters can be preceded by a backslash to
;;; cause it to be treated as a regular character.

;;;; TRUENAME, PROBE-FILE, FILE-AUTHOR, FILE-WRITE-DATE.

;;; Rewritten in 12/2007 by RMK, replacing 13+ year old CMU code that
;;; made a mess of things in order to support search lists (which SBCL
;;; has never had).  These are now all relatively straightforward
;;; wrappers around stat(2) and realpath(2), with the same basic logic
;;; in all cases.  The wrinkles to be aware of:
;;;
;;; * SBCL defines the truename of an existing, dangling or
;;;   self-referring symlink to be the symlink itself.
;;; * The old version of PROBE-FILE merged the pathspec against
;;;   *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* twice, and so lost when *D-P-D*
;;;   was a relative pathname.  Even if the case where *D-P-D* is a
;;;   relative pathname is problematic, there's no particular reason
;;;   to get that wrong, so let's try not to.
;;; * Note that while stat(2) is probably atomic, getting the truename
;;;   for a filename involves poking all over the place, and so is
;;;   subject to race conditions if other programs mutate the file
;;;   system while we're resolving symlinks.  So it's not implausible for
;;;   realpath(3) to fail even if stat(2) succeeded.  There's nothing
;;;   obvious we can do about this, however.
;;; * Windows' apparent analogue of realpath(3) is called
;;;   GetFullPathName, and it's a bit less useful than realpath(3).
;;;   In particular, while realpath(3) errors in case the file doesn't
;;;   exist, GetFullPathName seems to return a filename in all cases.
;;;   As realpath(3) is not atomic anyway, we only ever call it when
;;;   we think a file exists, so just be careful when rewriting this
;;;   routine.
;;;
;;; Given a pathname designator, some quality to query for, return one
;;; of a pathname, a universal time, or a string (a file-author), or
;;; NIL.  QUERY-FOR may be one of :TRUENAME, :EXISTENCE, :WRITE-DATE,
;;; :AUTHOR.  If ERRORP is false, return NIL in case the file system
;;; returns an error code; otherwise, signal an error.  Accepts
;;; logical pathnames, too (but never returns LPNs).  For internal
;;; use.

  "Map over entries in DIRECTORY. Keyword arguments specify which entries to
map over, and how:

 :FILES
    If true, call FUNCTION with the pathname of each file in DIRECTORY.
    Defaults to T.

 :DIRECTORIES
   If true, call FUNCTION with a pathname for each subdirectory of DIRECTORY.
   If :AS-FILES, the pathname used is a pathname designating the subdirectory
   as a file in DIRECTORY. Otherwise the pathname used is a directory
   pathname. Defaults to T.

 :CLASSIFY-SYMLINKS
   If T, the decision to call FUNCTION with the pathname of a symbolic link
   depends on the resolution of the link: if it points to a directory, it is
   considered a directory entry, otherwise a file entry. If false, all
   symbolic links are considered file entries. Defaults to T. In both cases
   the pathname used for the symbolic link is not fully resolved, but names it
   as an immediate child of DIRECTORY.

 :ERRORP
   If true, signal an error if DIRECTORY does not exist, cannot be read, etc.

;;; NOTE: There is a fair amount of hair below that is probably not
;;; strictly necessary.
;;;
;;; The issue is the following: what does (DIRECTORY "SYS:*;") mean?
;;; Until 2004-01, SBCL's behaviour was unquestionably wrong, as it
;;; did not translate the logical pathname at all, but instead treated
;;; it as a physical one.  Other Lisps seem to to treat this call as
;;; equivalent to (DIRECTORY (TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME "SYS:*;")),
;;; which is fine as far as it goes, but not very interesting, and
;;; arguably counterintuitive.  (PATHNAME-MATCH-P "SYS:SRC;" "SYS:*;")
;;; is true, so why should "SYS:SRC;" not show up in the call to
;;; DIRECTORY?  (assuming the physical pathname corresponding to it
;;; exists, of course).
;;;
;;; So, the interpretation that I am pushing is for all pathnames
;;; matching the input pathname to be queried.  This means that we
;;; need to compute the intersection of the input pathname and the
;;; logical host FROM translations, and then translate the resulting
;;; pathname using the host to the TO translation; this treatment is
;;; recursively invoked until we get a physical pathname, whereupon
;;; our physical DIRECTORY implementation takes over.

;;; FIXME: this is an incomplete implementation.  It only works when
;;; both are logical pathnames (which is OK, because that's the only
;;; case when we call it), but there are other pitfalls as well: see
;;; the DIRECTORY-HELPER below for some, but others include a lack of
;;; pattern handling.

;;; The above was written by CSR, I (RMK) believe.  The argument that
;;; motivates the interpretation is faulty, however: PATHNAME-MATCH-P
;;; returns true for (PATHNAME-MATCH-P #P"/tmp/*/" #P"/tmp/../"), but
;;; the latter pathname is not in the result of DIRECTORY on the
;;; former.  Indeed, if DIRECTORY were constrained to return the
;;; truename for every pathname for which PATHNAME-MATCH-P returned
;;; true and which denoted a filename that named an existing file,
;;; (DIRECTORY #P"/tmp/**/") would be required to list every file on a
;;; Unix system, since any file can be named as though it were "below"
;;; /tmp, given the dotdot entries.  So I think the strongest
;;; "consistency" we can define between PATHNAME-MATCH-P and DIRECTORY
;;; is that PATHNAME-MATCH-P returns true of everything DIRECTORY
;;; returns, but not vice versa.

;;; In any case, even if the motivation were sound, DIRECTORY on a
;;; wild logical pathname has no portable semantics.  I see nothing in
;;; ANSI that requires implementations to support wild physical
;;; pathnames, and so there need not be any translation of a wild
;;; logical pathname to a phyiscal pathname.  So a program that calls
;;; DIRECTORY on a wild logical pathname is doing something
;;; non-portable at best.  And if the only sensible semantics for
;;; DIRECTORY on a wild logical pathname is something like the
;;; following, it would be just as well if it signaled an error, since
;;; a program can't possibly rely on the result of an intersection of
;;; user-defined translations with a file system probe.  (Potentially
;;; useful kinds of "pathname" that might not support wildcards could
;;; include pathname hosts that model unqueryable namespaces like HTTP
;;; URIs, or that model namespaces that it's not convenient to
;;; investigate, such as the namespace of TCP ports that some network
;;; host listens on.  I happen to think it a bad idea to try to
;;; shoehorn such namespaces into a pathnames system, but people
;;; sometimes claim to want pathnames for these things.)  -- RMK
