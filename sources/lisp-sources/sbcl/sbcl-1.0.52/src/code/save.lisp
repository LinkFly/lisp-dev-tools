  "Save a \"core image\", i.e. enough information to restart a Lisp
process later in the same state, in the file of the specified name.
Only global state is preserved: the stack is unwound in the process.

The following &KEY arguments are defined:

  :TOPLEVEL
     The function to run when the created core file is resumed. The
     default function handles command line toplevel option processing
     and runs the top level read-eval-print loop. This function returning
     is equivalent to (SB-EXT:QUIT :UNIX-STATUS 0) being called.

  :EXECUTABLE
     If true, arrange to combine the SBCL runtime and the core image
     to create a standalone executable.  If false (the default), the
     core image will not be executable on its own. Executable images
     always behave as if they were passed the --noinform runtime option.

  :SAVE-RUNTIME-OPTIONS
     If true, values of runtime options --dynamic-space-size and
     --control-stack-size that were used to start SBCL are stored in
     the standalone executable, and restored when the executable is
     run. This also inhibits normal runtime option processing, causing
     all command line arguments to be passed to the toplevel.
     Meaningless if :EXECUTABLE is NIL.

  :PURIFY
     If true (the default on cheneygc), do a purifying GC which moves all
     dynamically allocated objects into static space. This takes
     somewhat longer than the normal GC which is otherwise done, but
     it's only done once, and subsequent GC's will be done less often
     and will take less time in the resulting core file. See the PURIFY
     function. This parameter has no effect on platforms using the
     generational garbage collector.

  :ROOT-STRUCTURES
     This should be a list of the main entry points in any newly loaded
     systems. This need not be supplied, but locality and/or GC performance
     may be better if they are. Meaningless if :PURIFY is NIL. See the
     PURIFY function.

  :ENVIRONMENT-NAME
     This is also passed to the PURIFY function when :PURIFY is T.
     (rarely used)

  :COMPRESSION
     This is only meaningful if the runtime was built with the :SB-CORE-COMPRESSION
     feature enabled. If NIL (the default), saves to uncompressed core files. If
     :SB-CORE-COMPRESSION was enabled at build-time, the argument may also be
     an integer from -1 to 9, corresponding to zlib compression levels, or T
     (which is equivalent to the default compression level, -1).

The save/load process changes the values of some global variables:

  *STANDARD-OUTPUT*, *DEBUG-IO*, etc.
    Everything related to open streams is necessarily changed, since
    the OS won't let us preserve a stream across save and load.

  *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*
    This is reinitialized to reflect the working directory where the
    saved core is loaded.

SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE interacts with SB-ALIEN:LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT: see its
documentation for details.

On threaded platforms only a single thread may remain running after
SB-EXT:*SAVE-HOOKS* have run. Applications using multiple threads can
be SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE friendly by registering a save-hook that quits
any additional threads, and an init-hook that restarts them.

This implementation is not as polished and painless as you might like:
  * It corrupts the current Lisp image enough that the current process
    needs to be killed afterwards. This can be worked around by forking
    another process that saves the core.
  * There is absolutely no binary compatibility of core images between
    different runtime support programs. Even runtimes built from the same
    sources at different times are treated as incompatible for this
    purpose.
This isn't because we like it this way, but just because there don't
seem to be good quick fixes for either limitation and no one has been
sufficiently motivated to do lengthy fixes."
