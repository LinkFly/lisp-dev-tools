;;; If TYPE is a type that we can do a compile-time test on, then
;;; return whether the object is of that type as the first value and
;;; second value true. Otherwise return NIL, NIL.
;;;
;;; We give up on unknown types and pick off FUNCTION- and COMPOUND-
;;; types. For STRUCTURE- types, we require that the type be defined
;;; in both the current and compiler environments, and that the
;;; INCLUDES be the same.
;;;
;;; KLUDGE: This should probably be a type method instead of a big
;;; ETYPECASE. But then the type method system should probably be CLOS
;;; too, and until that happens wedging more stuff into it might be
;;; messy. So I've left it a big ETYPECASE. -- 2001-03-16
