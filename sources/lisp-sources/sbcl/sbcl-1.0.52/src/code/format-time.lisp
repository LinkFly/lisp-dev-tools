;;; CMU CL made the default style :SHORT here. I've changed that to :LONG, on
;;; the theory that since the 8/7/1999 style is hard to decode unambiguously,
;;; you should have to ask for it explicitly. (I prefer YYYYMMDD myself, since
;;; it sorts properly.:-) -- WHN 19990831
;;;
;;; FIXME: On the CMU CL mailing list 30 Jan 2000, Pierre Mai suggested
;;;   OTOH it probably wouldn't be a major problem to change compile-file to
;;;   use for example :long, so that the output would be Month DD, YYYY, or
;;;   even better to extend format-universal-time with a flag to output ISO
;;;   8601 formats (like e.g. :iso-8601 and :iso-8601-short) and migrate
;;;   slowly towards ISO dates in the user code...
;;; The :ISO-8601 and :ISO-8601-SHORT options sound sensible to me. Maybe
;;; someone will do them for CMU CL and we can steal them for SBCL.
