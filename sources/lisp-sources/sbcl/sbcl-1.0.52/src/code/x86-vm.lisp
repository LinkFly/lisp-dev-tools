;;;; OS-CONTEXT-T

;;; a POSIX signal context, i.e. the type passed as the third
;;; argument to an SA_SIGACTION-style signal handler
;;;
;;; The real type does have slots, but at Lisp level, we never
;;; access them, or care about the size of the object. Instead, we
;;; always refer to these objects by pointers handed to us by the C
;;; runtime library, and ask the runtime library any time we need
;;; information about the contents of one of these objects. Thus, it
;;; works to represent this as an object with no slots.
;;;
;;; KLUDGE: It would be nice to have a type definition analogous to
;;; C's "struct os_context_t;", for an incompletely specified object
;;; which can only be referred to by reference, but I don't know how
;;; to do that in the FFI, so instead we just this bogus no-slots
;;; representation. -- WHN 20000730
;;;
;;; FIXME: Since SBCL, unlike CMU CL, uses this as an opaque type,
;;; it's no longer architecture-dependent, and probably belongs in
;;; some other package, perhaps SB-KERNEL.

;;;; low-level signal context access functions
;;;;
;;;; Note: In CMU CL, similar functions were hardwired to access
;;;; BSD-style sigcontext structures defined as alien objects. Our
;;;; approach is different in two ways:
;;;;   1. We use POSIX SA_SIGACTION-style signals, so our context is
;;;;      whatever the void pointer in the sigaction handler dereferences
;;;;      to, not necessarily a sigcontext.
;;;;   2. We don't try to maintain alien definitions of the context
;;;;      structure at Lisp level, but instead call alien C functions
;;;;      which take care of access for us. (Since the C functions can
;;;;      be defined in terms of system standard header files, they
;;;;      should be easier to maintain; and since Lisp code uses signal
;;;;      contexts only in interactive or exception code (like the debugger
;;;;      and internal error handling) the extra runtime cost should be
;;;;      negligible.
