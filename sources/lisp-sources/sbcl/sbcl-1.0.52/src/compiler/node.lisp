;;; The front-end data structure (IR1) is composed of nodes,
;;; representing actual evaluations. Linear sequences of nodes in
;;; control-flow order are combined into blocks (but see
;;; JOIN-SUCCESSOR-IF-POSSIBLE for precise conditions); control
;;; transfers inside a block are represented with CTRANs and between
;;; blocks -- with BLOCK-SUCC/BLOCK-PRED lists; data transfers are
;;; represented with LVARs.
