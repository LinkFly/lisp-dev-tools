;;;; "cold" core image builder: This is how we create a target Lisp
;;;; system from scratch, by converting from fasl files to an image
;;;; file in the cross-compilation host, without the help of the
;;;; target Lisp system.
;;;;
;;;; As explained by Rob MacLachlan on the CMU CL mailing list Wed, 06
;;;; Jan 1999 11:05:02 -0500, this cold load generator more or less
;;;; fakes up static function linking. I.e. it makes sure that all the
;;;; DEFUN-defined functions in the fasl files it reads are bound to the
;;;; corresponding symbols before execution starts. It doesn't do
;;;; anything to initialize variable values; instead it just arranges
;;;; for !COLD-INIT to be called at cold load time. !COLD-INIT is
;;;; responsible for explicitly initializing anything which has to be
;;;; initialized early before it transfers control to the ordinary
;;;; top level forms.
;;;;
;;;; (In CMU CL, and in SBCL as of 0.6.9 anyway, functions not defined
;;;; by DEFUN aren't set up specially by GENESIS. In particular,
;;;; structure slot accessors are not set up. Slot accessors are
;;;; available at cold init time because they're usually compiled
;;;; inline. They're not available as out-of-line functions until the
;;;; toplevel forms installing them have run.)

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is
;;;; provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS
;;;; files for more information.

;;; way to do this in high level data like this (as opposed to e.g. in
;;; IP packets), and in fact the CMU CL version number never ended up
;;; being incremented past 0. A better approach might be to use a
;;; string which is set from CVS data. (Though now as of sbcl-0.7.8 or
;;; so, we have another problem that the core incompatibility
;;; detection mechanisms are on such a hair trigger -- with even
;;; different builds from the same sources being considered
;;; incompatible -- that any coarser-grained versioning mechanisms
;;; like this are largely irrelevant as long as the hair-triggering
