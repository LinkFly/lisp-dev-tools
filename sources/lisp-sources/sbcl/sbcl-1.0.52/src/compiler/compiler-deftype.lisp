     ;; expanders are often function objects which can't easily be
     ;; compared for equivalence. And just warning on redefinition
     ;; isn't good, since DEFTYPE necessarily does its thing once at
     ;; compile time and again at load time, so that it's very common
     ;; and normal for types to be defined twice. So since there
     ;; doesn't seem to be anything simple and obvious to do, and
     ;; since mistakenly redefining a type isn't a common error
     ;; anyway, we just don't worry about trying to warn about it.
