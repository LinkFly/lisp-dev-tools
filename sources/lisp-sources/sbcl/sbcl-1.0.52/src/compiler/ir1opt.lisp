;;;; This file implements the IR1 optimization phase of the compiler.
;;;; IR1 optimization is a grab-bag of optimizations that don't make
;;;; major changes to the block-level control flow and don't use flow
;;;; analysis. These optimizations can mostly be classified as
;;;; "meta-evaluation", but there is a sizable top-down component as
;;;; well.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
