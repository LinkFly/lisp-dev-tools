;;; An INLINEP value describes how a function is called. The values
;;; have these meanings:
;;;     NIL     No declaration seen: do whatever you feel like, but don't
;;;             dump an inline expansion.
;;; :NOTINLINE  NOTINLINE declaration seen: always do full function call.
;;;    :INLINE  INLINE declaration seen: save expansion, expanding to it
;;;             if policy favors.
;;; :MAYBE-INLINE
;;;             Retain expansion, but only use it opportunistically.
;;;             :MAYBE-INLINE is quite different from :INLINE. As explained

;;;; DEFTRANSFORM

;;; Define an IR1 transformation for NAME. An IR1 transformation
;;; computes a lambda that replaces the function variable reference
;;; for the call. A transform may pass (decide not to transform the
;;; call) by calling the GIVE-UP-IR1-TRANSFORM function. LAMBDA-LIST
;;; both determines how the current call is parsed and specifies the
;;; LAMBDA-LIST for the resulting lambda.
;;;
;;; We parse the call and bind each of the lambda-list variables to
;;; the lvar which represents the value of the argument. When parsing
;;; the call, we ignore the defaults, and always bind the variables
;;; for unsupplied arguments to NIL. If a required argument is
;;; missing, an unknown keyword is supplied, or an argument keyword is
;;; not a constant, then the transform automatically passes. The
;;; DECLARATIONS apply to the bindings made by DEFTRANSFORM at
;;; transformation time, rather than to the variables of the resulting
;;; lambda. Bound-but-not-referenced warnings are suppressed for the
;;; lambda-list variables. The DOC-STRING is used when printing
;;; efficiency notes about the defined transform.
;;;
;;; Normally, the body evaluates to a form which becomes the body of
;;; an automatically constructed lambda. We make LAMBDA-LIST the
;;; lambda-list for the lambda, and automatically insert declarations
;;; of the argument and result types. If the second value of the body
;;; is non-null, then it is a list of declarations which are to be
;;; inserted at the head of the lambda. Automatic lambda generation
;;; may be inhibited by explicitly returning a lambda from the body.
;;;
;;; The ARG-TYPES and RESULT-TYPE are used to create a function type
;;; which the call must satisfy before transformation is attempted.
;;; The function type specifier is constructed by wrapping (FUNCTION
;;; ...) around these values, so the lack of a restriction may be
;;; specified by omitting the argument or supplying *. The argument
;;; syntax specified in the ARG-TYPES need not be the same as that in
;;; the LAMBDA-LIST, but the transform will never happen if the
;;; syntaxes can't be satisfied simultaneously. If there is an
;;; existing transform for the same function that has the same type,
;;; then it is replaced with the new definition.
;;;
;;; These are the legal keyword options:
;;;   :RESULT - A variable which is bound to the result lvar.
;;;   :NODE   - A variable which is bound to the combination node for the call.
;;;   :POLICY - A form which is supplied to the POLICY macro to determine
;;;             whether this transformation is appropriate. If the result
;;;             is false, then the transform automatically gives up.
;;;   :EVAL-NAME
;;;           - The name and argument/result types are actually forms to be
;;;             evaluated. Useful for getting closures that transform similar
;;;             functions.
;;;   :DEFUN-ONLY
;;;           - Don't actually instantiate a transform, instead just DEFUN
;;;             Name with the specified transform definition function. This
;;;             may be later instantiated with %DEFTRANSFORM.
;;;   :IMPORTANT
;;;           - If supplied and non-NIL, note this transform as ``important,''
;;;             which means efficiency notes will be generated when this
;;;             transform fails even if INHIBIT-WARNINGS=SPEED (but not if
