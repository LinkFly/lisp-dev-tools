;;; SBCL has no proper byte compiler (having ditched the rather
;;; ambitious and slightly flaky byte compiler inherited from CMU CL)
;;; but its FOPs are a sort of byte code which is expressive enough
;;; that we can compile some simple toplevel forms directly to them,
;;; including very common operations like the forms that DEFVARs and
;;; DECLAIMs macroexpand into.
(defun fopcompilable-p (form)
  ;; We'd like to be able to handle
  ;;   -- simple funcalls, nested recursively, e.g.
  ;;      (SET '*PACKAGE* (FIND-PACKAGE "CL-USER"))
  ;;   -- common self-evaluating forms like strings and keywords and
  ;;      fixnums, which are important for terminating
  ;;      the recursion of the simple funcalls above
  ;;   -- quoted lists (which are important for PROCLAIMs, which are
  ;;      common toplevel forms)
  ;;   -- fopcompilable stuff wrapped around non-fopcompilable expressions,
  ;;      e.g.
  ;;        (%DEFUN 'FOO (LAMBDA () ...) ...)
  ;;   -- the IF special form, to support things like (DEFVAR *X* 0)
  ;;      expanding into (UNLESS (BOUNDP '*X*) (SET '*X* 0))
  ;;
  ;; Special forms which we don't currently handle, but might consider
  ;; supporting in the future are LOCALLY (with declarations),
  ;; MACROLET, SYMBOL-MACROLET and THE.
