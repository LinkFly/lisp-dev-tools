optimization and type checking, but TRACE will not show recursive
calls. If the function object is bound to another name BAR, and FOO is
bound to another function, calls to FOO inside BAR will remain to be
recursive.

When disabled, internal references to a function FOO will be
considered ti be a call of a function, bound to the symbol at
run-time, which is less efficient. TRACE will show recursive calls. In
case of renaming described above, calls to FOO will not be recursive
and will refer to the new function, bound to FOO.")
