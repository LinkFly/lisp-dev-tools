;;; Like the DEFMETHOD macro, the expansion of the DEFCLASS macro is
;;; fixed. DEFCLASS always expands into a call to LOAD-DEFCLASS. Until
;;; the meta-braid is set up, LOAD-DEFCLASS has a special definition
;;; which simply collects all class definitions up, when the metabraid
;;; is initialized it is done from those class definitions.
;;;
;;; After the metabraid has been setup, and the protocol for defining
;;; classes has been defined, the real definition of LOAD-DEFCLASS is
;;; installed by the file std-class.lisp

;;; !BOOTSTRAP-GET-SLOT and !BOOTSTRAP-SET-SLOT are used to access and

;;; bootstrapping, there are only two kinds of objects whose slots we
;;; need to access, CLASSes and SLOT-DEFINITIONs. The first argument
;;; to these functions tells whether the object is a CLASS or a
;;; SLOT-DEFINITION.
;;;
;;; Note that the way this works it stores the slot in the same place
;;; in memory that the full object system will expect to find it
;;; later. This is critical to the bootstrapping process, the whole
;;; changeover to the full object system is predicated on this.
;;;
;;; One important point is that the layout of standard classes and
;;; standard slots must be computed the same way in this file as it is
;;; by the full object system later.
