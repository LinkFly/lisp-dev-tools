# The "--Wl,--export-dynamic" flags are here to help people
# experimenting with callbacks from C to SBCL, by allowing linkage to
# SBCL src/runtime/*.c symbols from C. Work on this is good, but it's
# definitely bleeding edge and not particularly stable. In particular,
# not only are the workarounds for the GC relocating Lisp code and
# data unstable, but even the basic calling convention might end up
# being unstable. Unless you want to do some masochistic maintenance
# work when new releases of SBCL come out, please don't try to build
# real code on this until a coherent stable interface has been added.
# (You *are* encouraged to design and implement a coherent stable
# interface, though.:-| As far as I (WHN 2002-05-19) know, no one is
# working on one and it would be a nice thing to have.)
