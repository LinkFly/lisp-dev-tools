;;;; code to detect whether a package has changed
;;;;
;;;; This is really old code which was most useful when first
;;;; bootstrapping SBCL when only CMU CL was available as an XC host.
;;;; Its main purpose was to check that legacy code like DEFMACRO
;;;; DOLIST and DEFUN IR1-OPTIMIZE-UNTIL-DONE was all correctly
;;;; converted from code which mutated the XC host into code which
;;;; built things for the target.
;;;;
;;;; These days, things like DEFUN IR1-OPTIMIZE-UNTIL-DONE can't very
;;;; well be mutating the cross-compiler host because we can build
;;;; successfully under OpenMCL, which shouldn't have the same
;;;; packages or symbols. So we don't need to worry very much about
;;;; modifying the XC host's private packages. However, it's still
;;;; conceivable that something affecting the XC host's CL package
;;;; (maybe DEFMACRO DOLIST?) could be written in such a way that it
;;;; would silently compile under SBCL, CMU CL, and even OpenMCL, and
;;;; still be fundamentally wrong. Since it'd be good to prevent such
;;;; modifications of the XC host's CL package, this code is still
;;;; retained despite being a little strange.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is
