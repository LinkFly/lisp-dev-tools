Simple streams are an extensible streams protocol that avoids some
problems with Gray streams.

Documentation about simple streams is available at:

@uref{http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.2/doc/streams.htm}

The implementation should be considered Alpha-quality; the basic
framework is there, but many classes are just stubs at the moment. 

See @file{SYS:CONTRIB;SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS;SIMPLE-STREAM-TEST.LISP} for
things that should work.

Known differences to the ACL behaviour:

@itemize

@item
@code{open} not return a simple-stream by default. This can be
adjusted; see default-open-class in the file cl.lisp

@item
@code{write-vector} is unimplemented.

@end itemize
