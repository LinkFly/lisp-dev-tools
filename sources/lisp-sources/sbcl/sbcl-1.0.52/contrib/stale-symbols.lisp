;;; This code is currently essentially the same as code posted by Eric
;;; Marsden to cmucl-imp, to detect stale symbols in a core.
;;;
;;; Known deficiencies:
;;;
;;; * output is not necessarily terribly clear;
;;; * takes a long time (several hours on CSR's 300MHz x86 desktop) to
;;;   run.
;;;
;;; Comment from Eric Marsden:
;;;
;;; This file contains code that attempts to identify symbols in a
;;; CMUCL image that are stale. For example, the package descriptions
;;; in src/code/package.lisp can get out of sync with the source code,
;;; leading to symbols that are exported without being used anywhere.
;;;
;;; The routines work by walking all the objects allocated in a heap
;;; image (using the function VM::MAP-ALLOCATED-OBJECTS). For each
;;; object of type symbol, it scans the entire heap for objects that
;;; reference that symbol. If it finds no references, or if there is
;;; only one reference that looks like it is likely from the internals
;;; of a package-related datastructure, the name of the symbol and its
;;; package is displayed.
;;;
;;; The "references to that symbol" are found using the function
;;; SB-VM::MAP-REFERENCING-OBJECTS. Consider for example a function
;;; that uses the value of a symbol. The code-object for that function
;;; contains a reference to the symbol, so that a call to SYMBOL-VALUE
;;; can be made at runtime. The data structures corresponding to a
;;; package must maintain a list of its exported an imported symbols.
;;; They contain a hashtable, which contains a vector, which contains
;;; symbols. So all exported symbols will have at least one
;;; referencing object: a vector related to some package.
;;;
;;; Limitations: these routines may provide a number of false
;;; positives (symbols that are not actually stale).  There are also a
;;; number of PCL-related symbols that are displayed, but probably
;;; used internally by PCL.  Moral: the output of these routines must
;;; be checked carefully before going on a code deletion spree.
