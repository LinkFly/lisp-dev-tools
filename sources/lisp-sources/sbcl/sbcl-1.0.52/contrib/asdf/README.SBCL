The copies of asdf.lisp, asdf.texinfo, README, and LICENSE in this
directory are complete and unchanged from the canonical versions at

  http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.git 

They may lag the upstream version by a few revisions (but shouldn't
usually) but unless we've fouled up horribly, are not forked.

The README file thus applies in its entirety apart from the scary
warnings about making sure you have the right version and it has not
been mutilated.
