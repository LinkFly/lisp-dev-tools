Packaging SBCL
==============

If you package SBCL for distribution, we ask that you to take steps to
make the version number reflect this. Our users often report bugs that
are intimately tied up with configuration issues, and much confusion
can result from mistaking a packaged SBCL for the upstream one.

If you are working from a Git branch, all you need to do is make sure
the branch name reflects the situation -- the build system will
incorporate the it in the version string.

If you are working from a release tarball, please edit
version.lisp-expr, and append ".packaging-target-or-patch[.version]".

Examples:

 "1.0.50.gentoo"
 "1.0.50.mikes-rpms.2"

This will make the startup banner, --version, and
(lisp-implementation-version) all identify the packaged version
correctly.
