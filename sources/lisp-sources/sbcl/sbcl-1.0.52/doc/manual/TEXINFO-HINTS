Some hints for editing the manual files.  Feel free to add anything
that will save the next person some time.  Thanks!


- There's no need for Next, Prev, etc. pointers in @node lines:
  makeinfo will deduce these automatically when the line after @node
  contains a sectioning command like @section, @subsection.  Hence,
  texinfo-multiple-files-update should not be used either.

- Don't create or update Menus by hand; use C-c C-u C-a
  (texinfo-all-menus-update) instead.  (Doesn't work in sbcl.texinfo,
  but this file is only changed when an entire chapter is added.)
