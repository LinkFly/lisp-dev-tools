;;;; tests for former BUG 99, where pretty-printing was pretty messed
;;;; up, e.g. PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK - because of CHECK-FOR-CIRCULARITY
;;;; - didn't really work:
;;;;   "DESCRIBE interacts poorly with *PRINT-CIRCLE*, e.g. the output from
;;;;    (let ((*print-circle* t)) (describe (make-hash-table)))
;;;;  is weird, [...] #<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQL :COUNT 0 {90BBFC5}> is an . (EQL)
;;;; ..."
;;;; So, this was mainly a pretty printing problem.

;;; Create a circular list.
