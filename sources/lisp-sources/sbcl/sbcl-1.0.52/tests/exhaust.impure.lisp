;;; Prior to sbcl-0.7.1.38, doing something like (RECURSE), even in
;;; safe code, would crash the entire Lisp process. Then the soft
;;; stack checking was introduced, which checked (in safe code) for
;;; stack exhaustion at each lambda.

;;; Post 0.7.6.1, this was rewritten to use mprotect()-based stack
;;; protection which does not require lisp code to check anything,
;;; and works at all optimization settings.  However, it now signals a
;;; STORAGE-CONDITION instead of an ERROR.
