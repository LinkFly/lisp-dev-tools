;;;;; Interrupting applicable method computation and calling the same
;;;;; GF that was being computed in the interrupt handler must not show
;;;;; up as metacircle.

;;; KLUDGE: We just want a way to ensure our interrupt happens at a
;;; bad place.
;;;
;;; FIXME: While an invasive hook like this is probably ok for testing
;;; purposes, it would also be good to have a proper interrupt-stress
;;; test for CLOS.
