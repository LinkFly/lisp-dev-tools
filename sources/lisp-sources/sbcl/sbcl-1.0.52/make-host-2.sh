# This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was

# In some cases, a debugging build of the system will creates a core
# file output/after-xc.core in the next step. In cases where it
# doesn't, it's confusing and basically useless to have any old copies
# lying around, so delete:
rm -f output/after-xc.core

# In a fresh host Lisp invocation, load and run the cross-compiler to
# create the target object files describing the target SBCL.
#
# (There are at least three advantages to running the cross-compiler in a
# fresh host Lisp invocation instead of just using the same Lisp invocation
# that we used to compile it:
#   (1) It reduces the chance that the cross-compilation process
#       inadvertently comes to depend on some weird compile-time
#       side effect.
#   (2) It reduces peak memory demand (because definitions wrapped in
#       (EVAL-WHEN (:COMPILE-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE) ..) aren't defined
#       in the fresh image).
#   (3) It makes it easier to jump in and retry a step when tweaking
#       and experimenting with the bootstrap procedure.
# Admittedly, these don't seem to be enormously important advantages, but
# the only disadvantage seems to be the extra time required to reload
# the fasl files into the new host Lisp, and that doesn't seem to be
# an enormously important disadvantage, either.)
